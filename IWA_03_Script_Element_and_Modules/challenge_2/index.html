<!--  
*Why does the code not work?
The term "private" was used instead of "const" or "let".
The display variable had some errors.
All the team member script files are not exporting their variables.
Script.js is not importing the team member scripts named imports.
Index.html did not import scripts.js correctly (it has to include the type attribute.)

*What changes do you need to make to achieve the intended behaviour?


*Are there any other ways in which it can be been solved?
Export the team members details as an object.
