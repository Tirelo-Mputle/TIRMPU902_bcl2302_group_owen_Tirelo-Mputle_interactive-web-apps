<!--  
*Why does the code not work?
Configuration.js does not export the variables.
The import statement in scripts.js are incorrect.
The script tag in index.html lacks the type attribute.

*What changes do you need to make to achieve the intended behaviour?
Export the company and year variables in configuration.js.
Import the named company and year exports in scripts.js.
Add type = "module" to script tag in index.html.

*Are there any other ways in which it can be been solved?
n/a
