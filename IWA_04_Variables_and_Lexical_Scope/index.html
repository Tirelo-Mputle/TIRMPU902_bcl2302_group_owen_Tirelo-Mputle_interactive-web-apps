<!-- 
*Why did the original code not work?

*What changes did you need to make to achieve the intended behaviour?
-Implicit variables
Set status and year variables implicitly with const (Uppercase text because they are hard coded).
Set count with let because it will get changed.
Use = instead of : to initialize the variables.

-Line 5 (first if statement)
Change = to ===. Check for strict equality instead of trying to assign it a new value.
Do this for all conditional in if statements.
Do not redeclare count each time. Remove the let keyword.
-line 9 
Don't reassign DATE variable.
Create local variable fourthMonth. Give it the value of "April".
Change appropriate "date" variable to fourthMonth.
Do not reassign count variable.

Repeat line 29 to 32.
Name the variable twelfthMonth and give it the value of "December"

*Why did the change result in the intended behaviour?
*Are there any other ways in which it could have been solved?
