<!-- 
*Why did the original code not work?

*What changes did you need to make to achieve the intended behaviour?
-Implicit variables
Set status and year variables implicitly with const (Uppercase text because they are hard coded).
Set count with let because it will get changed.
Use = instead of : to initialize the variables.

-Line 5 (first if statement)
Change = to ===. Check for strict equality instead of trying to assign it a new value.
Do this for all conditional in if statements.
Do not redeclare count each time. Remove the let keyword.
-line 9 
Don't reassign DATE variable.
Create local variable fourthMonth. Give it the value of "April".
*Why did the change result in the intended behaviour?
*Are there any other ways in which it could have been solved?
