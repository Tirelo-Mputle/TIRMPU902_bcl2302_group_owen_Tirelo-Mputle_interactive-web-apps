Book Connect, a social media platform specifically targeted at book enthusiasts. <br>

#### The aim of the app is to satisfy the following user stories.<br>
* As a user, I want to view a list of book previews, by title and author, so that I can discover new books to read. <br>
* As a user, I want an image associated with all book previews so that I can recognize a book by the cover even if I forgot the name. <br>
* As a user, I want to have the option of reading a summary of the book so that I can decide whether I want to read it. <br>
* As a user, I want to have the option of seeing the date that a book was published so that I can determine how easy it is to obtain second-hand. <br>
* As a user, I want to find books based on specific text phrases so that I don’t need to remember the entire title of a book. <br>
* As a user, I want to filter books by author so that I can find books to read by authors that I enjoy. <br>
* As a user, I want to filter books by genre so that I can find books to read in genres that I enjoy. <br>
* As a user, I want to toggle between dark and light modes so that I can use the app comfortably at night. <br>
